IMPORTANT NOTE

WrapITK is incompatible with all versions of Python before 2.5 on OS X
and Darwin platforms. This is due to a subtle bug/limitation in Python
on these platforms that was patched in version 2.5.

Unfortunately, Python 2.5 is itself subtly incompatible with the
current version of CableSWIG. Until CableSWIG is fixed, WrapITK must
be compiled with the '-fpermissive' flag. (Set this in the CPPFLAGS
variable in CMake.)

If you prefer to use a previous verison of Python, it is possible to
manually apply the patch and rebuild python yourself.
The patch is available here:
http://www.python.org/sf/1454844
or
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1454844&group_id=5470&atid=305470
The patch ('darwin_use_dlopen2.patch') has been tested with Python
versions 2.3 and 2.4, and will work on OS X 10.3 and later.
