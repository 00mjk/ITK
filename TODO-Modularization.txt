The modularized build system is not yet mature in at least these areas:

 - The Examples directory is not included in the build.

 - Doxygen processing has not been attempted.

 - BUILD_SHARED_LIBS on Windows does not work.  This requires sweeping
   dllexport markup changes which can work only after modularization.

Futher work will refine the new build system code moving forward.
