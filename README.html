INTRODUCTION
* What is ITK?

ITK is an open-source software toolkit for performing registration and
segmentation. Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data
found in a digitally sampled representation. Typically the sampled
representation is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT
or MRI scanners. Registration is the task of aligning or developing
corresponances betwen data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT
scane may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to combine the information
contained in both.

ITK is implemented in C++. In addition, an automated wrapping process
generates interfaces between C++ and interpreted programming languages such
as Tcl, Java, and Python. This enables developers to create software using a
variety of programming languages. ITK's C++ implementation style is referred
to as generic programming. Such C++ templating means that the code is highly
efficient, and that the many software problems are discovered at
compile-time, rather than at run-time during program execution.

Because ITK is an open-source project, developers from around the world can
use, debug, maintain, and extend the software. ITK uses a model of software
development referred to as Extreme Programming. Extreme Programming collapses
the usual software creation methodology into a simultaneous and iterative
process of design-implement-test-release. The key features of Extreme
Programming are communication and testing. Communication among the members 
of the ITK community is what helps manage the rapid evolution of the
software. Testing is what keeps the software stable. In ITK, an extensive
testing process is in place that measures the quality on a daily basis.

* Where are ITK's origins?

In 1999 the US National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of
Health awarded a three-year contract to develop an open-source registration
and segmentation toolkit, which eventually came to be known as the Insight
Toolkit (ITK). ITK's NLM Project Manager was Dr. Terry Yoo, who coordinated
the six prime contractors who made up the Insight consortium. These
consortium members included the three commerical partners GE Corporate R&D,
Kitware, Inc., and MathSoft; and the three academic partners University of
North Carolina (UNC), University of Tennessee (UT), and University of
Pennsylvania (UPenn). The Principle Investigators for these partners were,
resptively, Bill Lorensen at GE CRD, Will Schroeder at Kitware, Vikram
Chalana at Mathsoft, Steve Aylward at UNC, Ross Whitaker at UT, and xxx at
UPenn. In addition, several subcontractors rounded out the consortium
including Peter Raitu at Brigham & Women's Hospital, Pat Molholt and Celina
xxx at Columbia Univerity, Jim Gee at UPenn's Grasp Lab, and George Stetton
at Univerity of Pittsburgh. (Note: Ross Whitaker subsequently moved to
Univeristy of Utah in 2000.)

* Who are the developers?

The best way to determine the names of developers is to view the CVS source
code repository logs. Most of the early developers are listed in the
following, however, many developers beyond those listed here will participate
in the development of Insight as the code grows and becomes publically
accessible.

Some of the early developers include:

Dan Blezek - GE CRD; testing infrastructure
Josh Cates - Utah; imaging classes and filters
Bill Hoffman - Kitware; CMake (build process); vxl/vnl numerics; infrastructure (smart pointers, object factories, callback mechanism)
Luis Ibanez - UNC; imaging classes and filters
Brad King - Kitware; Mesh class, autowrapping of C++ code
Bill Lorensen - GE CRD; testing, requirements, architecture
Ken Martin - Kitware; Build process, architecture, infrastructure
Jim Miller - GR CRD; Image classes, iterators, pipeline update mechanism
Lydia Ng - Mathsoft; Image filters, algorithms
Will Schroeder - Kitware; Mesh classes, algorithms, core classes
George Stetton - Pittsburgh; image filters, algorithms


* How do I participate?

Because ITK is an open-source system, you can participate. If you'd like to
become involved, here are the following steps that you might consider.
1. Read this document
2. Obtain access to the CVS repository (read-only, anonymous access),
   and obtain the distribution using the following procedure.
3. Find the Insight/Documents/InsightStart.doc and read it thoroughly.
4. As this document suggests, join the insight-developers list.
5. Cntribute code or fix bugs by mailing code to the list or contacting 
   a developer directly.
6. Once you demonstrate your abilities, obtain read-write access to the
   repository. Access can be obtained by contacting Bill Hoffman at
   Kitware at 518-371-3971 x105 and leaving your desired account name
   and account password.

* What are the terms of use?

Because ITK was developed through US Government funding, it does not carry
a copyright as many open-source systems do. Instead, it carries a no-cost
license. The licence can be found at Insight/license.txt.

The important feature of the license is that it gives permission to use
Insight for any purpose, including commercial purposes, with ....  There is a
patented code found in the Insight/Code/Patented directory. If you use any of
these code in commercial application, you must contact the patent holder to
obtain permission.


TECHNICAL SUMMARY

The following sections summarize the technical features of the
NLM's Insight ITK toolkit.
