INTRODUCTION
* What is ITK?

ITK is an open-source software toolkit for performing registration and
segmentation. Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data
found in a digitally sampled representation. Typically the sampled
representation is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT
or MRI scanners. Registration is the task of aligning or developing
corresponances betwen data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT
scane may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to combine the information
contained in both.

ITK is implemented in C++. In addition, an automated wrapping process
generates interfaces between C++ and interpreted programming languages such
as Tcl, Java, and Python. This enables developers to create software using a
variety of programming languages. ITK's C++ implementation style is referred
to as generic programming. Such C++ templating means that the code is highly
efficient, and that the many software problems are discovered at
compile-time, rather than at run-time during program execution.

Because ITK is an open-source project, developers from around the world can
use, debug, maintain, and extend the software. ITK uses a model of software
development referred to as Extreme Programming. Extreme Programming collapses
the usual software creation methodology into a simultaneous and iterative
process of design-implement-test-release. The key features of Extreme
Programming are communication and testing. Communication among the members 
of the ITK community is what helps manage the rapid evolution of the
software. Testing is what keeps the software stable. In ITK, an extensive
testing process is in place that measures the quality on a daily basis.

* Where are ITK's origins?

In 1999 the US National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of
Health awarded a three-year contract to develop an open-source registration
and segmentation toolkit, which eventually came to be known as the Insight
Toolkit (ITK). ITK's NLM Project Manager was Dr. Terry Yoo, who coordinated
the six prime contractors who made up the Insight consortium. These
consortium members included the three commerical partners GE Corporate R&D,
Kitware, Inc., and MathSoft; and the three academic partners University of
North Carolina (UNC), University of Tennessee (UT), and University of
Pennsylvania (UPenn). The Principle Investigators for these partners were,
resptively, Bill Lorensen at GE CRD, Will Schroeder at Kitware, Vikram
Chalana at Mathsoft, Steve Aylward at UNC, Ross Whitaker at UT, and xxx at
UPenn. In addition, several subcontractors rounded out the consortium
including Peter Raitu at Brigham & Women's Hospital, Pat Molholt and Celina
xxx at Columbia Univerity, Jim Gee at UPenn's Grasp Lab, and George Stetton
at Univerity of Pittsburgh. (Note: Ross Whitaker subsequently moved to
Univeristy of Utah in 2000.)

* Who are the developers?

The best way to determine the names of developers is to view the CVS source
code repository logs. Most of the early developers are listed in the
following, however, many developers beyond those listed here will participate
in the development of Insight as the code grows and becomes publically
accessible.

Some of the early developers include:

Steve Aylward - UNC; architecture, algorithms
Dan Blezek - GE CRD; testing infrastructure
Josh Cates - Utah; imaging classes and filters
Bill Hoffman - Kitware; CMake (build process); vxl/vnl numerics; infrastructure (smart pointers, object factories, callback mechanism)
Paul Hughett - ; quality, algorithms
Luis Ibanez - UNC; imaging classes and filters
Brad King - Kitware; Mesh class, autowrapping of C++ code
Bill Lorensen - GE CRD; testing, requirements, architecture
Ken Martin - Kitware; Build process, architecture, infrastructure
Jim Miller - GR CRD; Image classes, iterators, pipeline update mechanism
Lydia Ng - Mathsoft; Image filters, algorithms
Will Schroeder - Kitware; Mesh classes, algorithms, core classes
George Stetton - Pittsburgh; image filters, algorithms
Ross Whitaker - Utah; architecture, algorithms


* How do I participate?

Because ITK is an open-source system, you can participate. If you'd like to
become involved, here are the following steps that you might consider.
1. Read this document
2. Obtain access to the CVS repository (read-only, anonymous access),
   and obtain the distribution using the following procedure.
3. Find the Insight/Documents/InsightStart.doc and read it thoroughly.
4. As this document suggests, join the insight-developers list.
5. Cntribute code or fix bugs by mailing code to the list or contacting 
   a developer directly.
6. Once you demonstrate your abilities, obtain read-write access to the
   repository. Access can be obtained by contacting Bill Hoffman at
   Kitware at 518-371-3971 x105 and leaving your desired account name
   and account password.

* What are the terms of use?

Because ITK was developed through US Government funding, it does not carry
a copyright as many open-source systems do. Instead, it carries a no-cost
license. The licence can be found at Insight/license.txt.

The important feature of the license is that it gives permission to use
Insight for any purpose, including commercial purposes, with ....  There is a
patented code found in the Insight/Code/Patented directory. If you use any of
these code in commercial application, you must contact the patent holder to
obtain permission.


TECHNICAL SUMMARY

The following sections summarize the technical features of the
NLM's Insight ITK toolkit.

* Design Philosophy
The following are key features of the toolkit design philosophy.

  * The toolkit provides data representation and algorithms for
    performing segmentation and registration. The focus is on medical
    applications; although the toolkit is capable of processing other
    types.

  * The toolkit provides data representations in general form for images
    (arbitrary dimension) and (unstructured) meshes.

  * The toolkit does not address visualization or graphical user interface.
    These are left to other toolkits (such as VTK, VisPack, MetaImage, etc.)

  * The toolkit provides minimal tools for file interface. Again, this is
    left to other toolkits/libraries to provide.

  * Multi-threaded (shared memory) parallel processing is supported.

  * The development of the toolkit is based on principles of extreme
    programming. That is, design, implementation, and testing is
    performed in a rapid, iterative process. Testing forms the core
    of this process. In Insight, testing is performed continuously
    as files are checked in, and every night across multiple platforms
    and compilers.

* Architecture 
The following are key features of the toolkit architecture.

  * The toolkit is organized around a data-flow architecture. That is,
    data is represented using data objects which are in turn processed
    by process objects (filters). Data objects and process objects are
    connected together into pipelines. Pipelines are capable of
    processing the data in pieces according to a user-specified memory
    limit set on the pipeline.

  * Object factories are used to instantiate objects. Factories allow
    run-time extension of the system.


* Implementation Philosophy
The following are key features of the toolkit implementation philosophy.

  * The toolkit is implemented using generic programming
    principles. Such heavily templated C++ code challenges many
    compilers; hence development was carried out with the latest
    versions of the MSVC, Sun, gcc, and SGI compilers.

  * The toolkit is cross-platform (Unix and Windows).

  * The toolkit supports multiple language bindings, including
    such languages as Tcl, Python, and Java. These bindings are generated
    automatically using an auto-wrap process.

  * The memory model depends on "smart pointers" that maintain a
    reference count to objects. Smart pointers can be allocated on the
    stack, and when scope is exited, the smart pointers disappear and
    decrement their reference count to the object that they refer to.

* Build Environment

Insight uses the CMake (cross-platform make) build environment. CMake
uses configure and make on Unix and generates projects and workspaces
in the windows environment.


FURTHER INFORMATION
The following information is available from the Insight CVS repository.

(To download Insight using CVS, use the following steps.
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/insight/cvsroot login
