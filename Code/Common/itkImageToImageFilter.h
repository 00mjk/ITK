/** \class ImageToImageFilter
 * \brief 
 *
 * ImageToImageFilter is the base class for all process objects that output
 * image data and require image data as input. Specifically, this class
 * defines the SetInput() method for defining the input to a filter.
 *
 * This class provides the infrastructure for supporting multithreaded
 * processing of images.  If a filter provides an implementation of
 * GenerateData(), the image processing will run in a single thread and the
 * implementation is responsible for allocating its output data.  If a filter
 * provides an implementation of ThreadedGenerateData() instead, the image
 * will be divided into a number of pieces, a number of threads will be
 * spawned, and ThreadedGenerateData() will be called in each thread.  Here,
 * the output memory will be allocated by this superclass prior to calling
 * ThreadedGenerateData().
 *
 * ImageToImageFilter provides an implementation of
 * GenerateInputRequestedRegion().  The base assumption to this point in the
 * heirarchy is that a process object would ask for the largest possible
 * region on input in order to produce any output.  Imaging filters,
 * however, can usually answer this question more precisely.  The default
 * implementation of GenerateInputRequestedRegion() in this class is to
 * request an input that matches the size of the requested output.  If a
 * filter requires more input (say a filter that uses neighborhood
 * information) or less input (for instance a magnify filter), then these
 * filters will have to provide another implmentation of this method. By
 * convention, such implementations should call the Superclass' method
 * first.
