/** \class InPlaceImageFilter
 * \brief Base class for filters that take an image as input and overwrite that image as the output
 *
 * InPlaceImageFilter is the base class for all process objects whose
 * output image data is constructed by overwriting the input image
 * data. In other words, the output bulk data is the same block of
 * memory as the input bulk data.  This filter provides the mechanisms
 * for in place image processing while maintaining general pipeline
 * mechanics. InPlaceImageFilters use less memory than standard
 * ImageToImageFilters because the input buffer is reused as the
 * output buffer.  However, this benefit does not come without a cost.
 * Since the filter overwrites its input, the ownership of the bulk
 * data is transitioned from the input data object to the output data
 * object.  When a data object has multiple consumers with one
 * of the consumers being an in place filter, the in place filter
 * effectively destroys the bulk data for the data object. Upstream
 * filters will then have to re-execute to regenerate the data object's
 * bulk data for the remaining consumers.
 *
 * Since an InPlaceImageFilter reuses the input bulk data memory for the
 * output bulk data memory, the input image type must match the output
 * image type.  Therefore, this class is only templated on the input image
 * type.
