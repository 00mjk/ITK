/** \class ZeroFluxNeumannBoundaryCondition
 * \brief
 * A function object that determines a neighborhood of values at an
 * image boundary according to a Neumann boundary condition where first,
 * upwind derivatives on the boundary are zero.  This is a useful condition 
 * in solving some classes of differential equations. 
 *
 * For example, invoking this function object on a 7x5 iterator that masks
 * a region at an image corner (iterator is centered on the 2):
 *
 *               * * * * * * * 
 *               * * * * * * *
 *               * * 1 2 3 4 5  (where * denotes pixels that lie 
 *               * * 3 3 5 5 6          outside of the image boundary)
 *               * * 4 4 6 7 8
 *
 * returns the following neighborhood of values:
 *
 *               1 1 1 2 3 4 5
 *               1 1 1 2 3 4 5
 *               1 1 1 2 3 4 5
 *               3 3 3 3 5 5 6   (note the corner values)
 *               4 4 4 4 6 7 8
 *
 * The input to this function object is a neighborhood iterator.  This boundary
 * condition object is designed to be given as a template argument to a
 * SmartNeighborhoodIterator or any of the SmartNeighborhoodIterator
 * subclasses.  It can also be used to override a default boundary condition
 * type in a SmartNeighborhoodIterator or any of the SmartNeighborhoodIterator
 * subclasses.
