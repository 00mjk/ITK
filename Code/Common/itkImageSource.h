 *  \brief Base class for all process objects that output image data.
 *
 * ImageSource is the base class for all process objects that output
 * image data. Specifically, this class defines the GetOutput() method
 * that returns a pointer to the output image. The class also defines
 * some internal private data memebers that are used to manage streaming
 * of data.

   * LargestPossibleRegion) and meta-data (Spacing, Origin) from the

   * importantly, however, it leaves the Source ivar untouched so the
   * original pipeline routing is intact. This method is used when a
   * process object is implemented using a mini-pipeline which is
   * defined in its GenerateData() method.  The usage is:
   *
   * \code
   *    // setup the mini-pipeline to process the input to this filter
   *    firstFilterInMiniPipeline->SetInput( this->GetInput() );

   *    lastFilterInMiniPipeline->Update();
   *
   *    // graft the mini-pipeline output back onto this filter's output.
   *    // this is needed to get the appropriate regions passed back.
   *    this->GraftOutput( lastFilterInMiniPipeline->GetOutput() );
   * \endcode
   *
   * For proper pipeline execution, a filter using a mini-pipeline
   * must implement the GenerateInputRequestedRegion(),
   * GenerateOutputRequestedRegion(), GenerateOutputInformation() and
   * EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion() methods as necessary to reflect
   * how the mini-pipeline will execute (in other words, the outer
   * filter's pipeline mechanism must be consistent with what the
   * mini-pipeline will do).

   * is disconnected, the ProcessObject needs to construct a replacement
   * output data object so that the ProcessObject is in a valid state.
   * So DataObject::DisconnectPipeline eventually calls
