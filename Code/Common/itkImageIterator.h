/**
 * \class ImageIterator
 * \brief Multi-dimensional image iterator.
 * 
 * ImageIterator is a templated class to represent a multi-dimensional
 * iterator. ImageIterator is templated over the dimension of the image
 * and the data type of the image.
 *
 * ImageIterator is a base class for all the image iterators. It provides
 * the basic construction and comparison operations.  However, it does not
 * provide mechanisms for moving the iterator.  A subclass of ImageIterator
 * must be used to move the iterator.
 * 
 * ImageIterator is a multi-dimensional iterator, requiring more information
 * be specified before the iterator can be used than conventional iterators.
 * Whereas the std::vector::iterator from the STL only needs to be passed
 * a pointer to establish the iterator, the multi-dimensional image iterator
 * needs a pointer, the size of the buffer, the size of the region, the
 * start index of the buffer, and the start index of the region. To gain
 * access to this information, ImageIterator holds a reference to the image
 * over which it is traversing.
 *
 * ImageIterator assumes a particular layout of the image data. In particular,
 * the data is arranged in a 1D array as if it were [][][][slice][row][col]
 * with Index[0] = col, Index[1] = row, Index[2] = slice, etc.
 *
