/**
 *\class ImageBoundaryCondition
 * \brief A virtual base object that defines an interface to a class of
 * boundary condition objects for use by neighborhood iterators.
 *
 * A boundary condition object supplies a phantom pixel value when
 * given a neighborhood of (pointers to) image values, the (ND) index of
 * the phantom pixel, and its (ND) offset from the boundary.  The index
 * of the phantom pixel is relative to the "upper left-hand corner" of
 * the neighborhood (as opposed to its center). 
 *
 * 
 * Associated Types                 Description
 * ----------------                 -----------
 * PixelType                         The data type of the return value.
 * PixelPointerType                  A pointer to PixelType.
 * PixelPointerTypeNeighborhood      A neighborhood of PixelPointerTypes
 *                                   that points to the pixel values in
 *                                   an image neighborhood.
