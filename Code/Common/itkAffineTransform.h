/**
 * Affine transformation of a vector space (e.g. space coordinates)
 *
 * This class allows the definition and manipulation of affine
 * transformations of an n-dimensional affine space (and its
 * associated vector space) onto itself.  One common use is to define
 * and manipulate Euclidean coordinate transformations in two and
 * three dimensions, but other uses are possible as well.
 *
 * An affine transformation is defined mathematically as a linear
 * transformation plus a constant offset.  If A is a constant n x n
 * matrix and b is a constant n-vector, then y = Ax+b defines an
 * affine transformation from the n-vector x to the n-vector y.
 *
 * The difference between two points is a vector and transforms
 * linearly, using the matrix only.  That is, (y1-y2) = A*(x1-x2).
 *
 * The AffineTransform class determines whether to transform an object
 * as a point or a vector by examining its type.  An object of type
 * Point transforms as a point; an object of type Vector transforms as
 * a vector.
 *
 * One common use of affine transformations is to define coordinate
 * conversions in two- and three-dimensional space.  In this
 * application, x is a two- or three-dimensional vector containing the
 * "source" coordinates of a point, y is a vector containing the
 * "target" coordinates, the matrix A defines the scaling and rotation
 * of the coordinate systems from the source to the target, and b
 * defines the translation of the origin from the source to the
 * target.  More generally, A can also define anisotropic scaling and
 * shearing transformations.  Any good textbook on computer graphics
 * will discuss coordinate transformations in more detail.  Several of
 * the methods in this class are designed for this purpose and use the
 * language appropriate to coordinate conversions.
 *
 * Any two affine transformations may be composed and the result is
 * another affine transformation.  However, the order is important.
 * Given two affine transformations T1 and T2, we will say that
 * "precomposing T1 with T2" yields the transformation which applies
 * T1 to the source, and then applies T2 to that result to obtain the
 * target.  Conversely, we will say that "postcomposing T1 with T2"
 * yields the transformation which applies T2 to the source, and then
 * applies T1 to that result to obtain the target.  (Whether T1 or T2
 * comes first lexicographically depends on whether you choose to
 * write mappings from right-to-left or vice versa; we avoid the whole
 * problem by referring to the order of application rather than the
 * textual order.)
 *
 * There are two template parameters for this class:
 *
 * ScalarT       The type to be used for scalar numeric values.  Either
 *               float or double.
 *
 * NDimensions   The number of dimensions of the vector space.
 *
 * This class provides several methods for setting the matrix and vector
 * defining the transform. To support the registration framework, the 
 * transform parameters can also be set as an Array<double> of size
 * (NDimension + 1) * NDimension using method SetParameters(). 
 * The first (NDimension x NDimension) parameters defines the matrix in 
 * column-major order (where the column index) varies the fastest). 
 * The last NDimension parameters defines the translation 
 * in each dimensions.
 *
 * This class also supports the specification of a center of rotation (center)
 * and a translation that is applied with respect to that centered rotation.
 * At any point, even when center and translation are being set, only the
 * matrix and offset form are assured to be valid.   For example, when an
 * offset is specified, we make no attempt to assure that the value used for
 * translation is updated; however, when the translation is changed, we ensure
 * that the value of the offset is correspondingly updated.
 *
 * \ingroup Transforms
 *
 *
 * \todo Is there any real value in allowing the user to template
 * over the scalar type?  Perhaps it should always be double, unless
 * there's a compatibility problem with the Point class.
 *
 * \todo Add methods to transform (or back transform)
 *   many points or vectors at once?
 *
 * \todo  Add reflection?  **/
