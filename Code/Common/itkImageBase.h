/** \class ImageBase
 * \brief Base class for templated image classes.
 *
 * ImageBase is the base class for the templated Image
 * classes. ImageBase is templated over the dimension of the image. It
 * provides the API and ivars that depend solely on the dimension of
 * the image.  ImageBase does not store any of the image (pixel) data.
 * Storage for the pixels and the pixel access methods are defined in
 * subclasses of ImageBase, namely Image and ImageAdaptor.
 *
 * There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
 * objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the 
 * image array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size 
 * and starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
 * may not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
 * memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
 * of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
 * the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
 * execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce. 
 *
