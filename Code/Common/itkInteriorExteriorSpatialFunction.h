/**
 * \class InteriorExteriorSpatialFunction
 * \brief Returns whether or not a location is "inside" or "outside" a function
 *
 * InteriorExteriorSpatialFunction is a specialized version of SpatialFunction
 * where the output type is a boolean. In particular, the return type is understood
 * to mean the following:
 *
 * A return of 1 means inside or on the surface of the function,
 * 0 means outside the function
 *
 * There is no implied meaning in the terms "inside" or "outside"; although
 * the standard assumption is that "inside" means "bounded by a closed surface",
 * alternative definitions are also fine. For example, inside might be one side
 * of a plane, outside the other side.
 *
 * A typical use for an InteriorExteriorSpatialFunction is to generate test
 * primitives of arbitrary dimensionality, in conjunction with
 * itk::SpatialFunctionImageEvaluatorFilter or itk::FloodFilledSpatialFunctionConditionalIterator
 *
 * \ingroup SpatialFunctions
