/**
 * \class FiniteDifferenceImageFilter
 *
 *  This class defines a high-level framework for solving partial differential
 *  equations using finite differences.  The input is an itkImage that
 *  represents the initial values and the output is an itkImage that
 *  represents the solution.
 *
 *  The high-level, iterative algorithm is implemented in this class (see the
 *  method GenerateData() ); 
 * \code
 *   WHILE NOT convergence:
 *     FOR ALL pixels i
 *        time_step = calculate_change(i)
 *        update(i, time_step)
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  The following equation describes update \f$n+1\f$ at pixel \f$i\f$ on
 *  discrete image \f$u\f$ : 
 *
 *  \f$u_{\mathbf{i}}^{n+1}=u^n_{\mathbf{i}}+\Delta u^n_{\mathbf{i}}\Delta t\f$
 *
 *  \todo Write GenerateInputRequestedRegion method to ask for appropriately
 *        padded buffers to process streamed chunks
