/** \class SmartPointerForwardReference
 * \brief Implements transparent reference counting in situations where forward
 *        references / cyclic include depndencies are a problem.
 *
 * SmartPointerForwardReference implements reference counting by overloading
 * operator -> (and *) among others. This allows natural interface
 * to the class referred to by the pointer without having to invoke
 * special Register()/UnRegister() methods directly.
 *
 * This class is nearly identical to itkSmartPointer except that is used in
 * situations where forward references or cyclic include dependencies become
 * a problem. This class requires that the .h file is included in the .h file
 * of the class using it, and the .txx file is included in the .cxx/.txx file
 * of the class using it. (Make sure that SmartPointerForwardReference.txx is
 * included last in the .cxx/.txx list of includes.)
