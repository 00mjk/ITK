/** \class Versor
 * \brief A templated class holding Unit Quaternion.
 * 
 * Versor is a templated class that holds a unit quaternion.
 * The difference between Versors and Quaternions is that Quaternions
 * can represent rotations and scale changes while Versors are limited
 * to rotations.
 *
 * This class only implements the operations that maintain Versors as
 * a group, that is, any operations between versors result in another
 * versor. For this reason, addition is not defined in this class, even
 * though it is a valid operation between quaternions.
