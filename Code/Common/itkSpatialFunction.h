/** \class SpatialFunction
 * \brief N-dimensional spatial function class
 *
 * itk::SpatialFunction provides the ability to define functions that can
 * be evluated at an arbitrary point in space (physical or otherwise). The return
 * type is specified by the derived class, and the input to the function
 * is an n-dimensional itk::Point.
 *
 * Although itk::ImageFunction and itk::SpatialFunction are quite similar,
 * itk::SpatialFunction derived classes exist without reference to an Image
 * type.
 *
 * SpatialFunction is templated over output type (the data type
 * returned by an evaluate() call) and dimensionality.
 *
