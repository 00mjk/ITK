/** \class SegmentationBorder
 * \brief Base class for SegmentationBorder object
 * 
 * itkSegmentationBorder is the base class for the SegmentationBorder
 * objects. It provides the basic function definitons that are inherent to a
 * SegmentationBorder objects.  This object stores information relevant to
 * the borders that are used in the region growing class. This class allows
 * access to the parameter that defines the length of the border associated
 * with this object.  In order to use this object in an application, the
 * object must be created within the application and then used to
 * initialize/store/use the various parameters accessible through the public
 * methods. For usage also see itkRegionGrowImageFiltering class.
 * This object can be used where a border of a region needs to be defined.
 * Chlid classes can be derived from this class for tailoring them towards 
 * specific algorithmic needs.
