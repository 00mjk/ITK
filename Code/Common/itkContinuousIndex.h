 * \brief A templated class holding a point in n-Dimensional image space.
 * 
 * ContinuousIndex is a templated class that holds a set of coordinates (components).
 * The template parameter TCoordRep can
 * be any data type that behaves like a primitive (or atomic) data type (int,
 * short, float, complex).  The VIndexDimension defines the number of
 * components in the continous index array.
