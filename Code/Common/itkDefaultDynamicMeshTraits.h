/** \class DefaultDynamicMeshTraits
 * DefaultDynamicMeshTraits is a simple structure that holds type information
 * for a mesh and its cells.  It is used to avoid the passing of many
 * template parameters while still enjoying the benefits of generic
 * programming.
 *
 * Unlike DefaultStaticMeshTraits, this version of the MeshTraits structure
 * is designed to create Mesh instances that will have many insert and delete
 * operations done on them.
 *
 * Template parameters for DefaultDynamicMeshTraits:
 *
 * TPixelType =
 *    The type stored as data for an entity (cell, point, or boundary).
 *
 * VPointDimension =
 *    Geometric dimension of space.
 *
 * VMaxTopologicalDimension =
 *    Max topological dimension of a cell that can be inserted into this mesh.
 *
 * TCoordRep =
 *    Numerical type to store each coordinate value.
 *
 * TInterpolationWeight =
 *    Numerical type to store interpolation weights.
 * 
 * \ingroup MeshObjects
