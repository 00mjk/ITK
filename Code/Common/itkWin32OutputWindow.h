/** \class Win32OutputWindow
 * \brief Collect error and debug messages on Win32-based systems.
 *
 * This class is used for error and debug message output on the windows
 * platform. It creates a read only EDIT control to display the
 * output. This class should not be used directly. It should
 * only be used through the interface of OutputWindow.  This class
 * only handles one output window per process.  If the window is destroyed,
 * the Object::GlobalWarningDisplayOff() function is called.  The
 * window is created the next time text is written to the window.
