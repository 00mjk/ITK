/** \class CosImageFilter
 * \brief Computes the cos(x) pixel-wise
 *
 * This filter is templated over the pixel type of the input image
 * and the pixel type of the output image. 
 *
 * The filter will walk over all the pixels in the input image, and for
 * each one of them it will do the following: 
 *
 * - cast the pixel value to \c double, 
 * - apply the \c cos() function to the \c double value
 * - cast the \c double value resulting from \c cos() to the pixel type of the output image 
 * - store the casted value into the output image.
 * 
 * The filter expect both images to have the same dimension (e.g. both 2D, or both 3D, or both ND)
 *
