/**
 * \class BinaryDilateImageFilter
 * \brief binary dilation of an image
 *
 * Dilate an image using binary morphology. Gray scale images can be
 * processed as binary images by selecting a "DilateValue".  Pixel values
 * matching the dilate value are considered the "foreground" and all other
 * pixels are "background". This is useful in processing segmented images
 * where all pixels in segment #1 have value 1 and pixels in segment #2
 * have value 2, etc. A particular "segment number" can be processed.
 * DilateValue defaults to the maximum possible value of the PixelType.
 *
 * Binary dilation will set a pixel as the "DilateValue" if any of the
 * pixels in the image under the structuring element have a value of
 * "DilateValue" and that structuring element value is greater than 0.
 *
 * The structuring element is assumed to be composed of binary
 * values (zero or one). Only elements of the structuring element
 * having values > 0 are candidates for affecting the center pixel.
 *
 * If none of the pixels under the structuring element have
 * DilateValue, the pixel under the center pixel value of the
 * structuring element is unchanged. If the center pixel is "in" the
 * structuring element (value > 0), then leaving the pixel unchanged
 * is the right things to do since that is most appropriate
 * "background" value for the pixel.  If the center pixel is not part
 * of the structuring element (a rare designation), then leaving the
 * pixel unchanged is not correct in the strict morphological
 * definition (operating on an image with multiple background values
 * is not defined in morphology).  Under these conditions, the center
 * pixel should be set to "a" background value.  However, we do not
 * know which background value to set it to.
 * 
 * For the each input image pixel, 
 *   - NeighborhoodIterator gives neighbors of the pixel. 
 *   - Evaluate() member function returns either the original pixel value
 *     or the DilateValue.
 *   - Replace the original value with the specified value
