/**
 * \class BinaryErodeImageFilter
 * \brief binary dilation of an image
 *
 * Erode an image using binary morphology. Gray scale images can be
 * processed as binary images by selecting a "ErodeValue".  Pixel values
 * matching the erode value are considered the "foreground" and all other
 * pixels are "background". This is useful in processing segmented images
 * where all pixels in segment #1 have value 1 and pixels in segment #2
 * have value 2, etc. A particular "segment number" can be processed.
 * ErodeValue defaults to the maximum possible value of the PixelType.
 *
 * Binary erosion will set a pixel as the "ErodeValue" if all of the
 * pixels in the image for "on" structuring element pixels have a
 * value of "ErodeValue".  Otherwise, the center pixel is set to an
 * appropriate "background" value. For lack of something better, the
 * background value used will be the minimum of the pixels that were
 * not the ErodeValue. 
 *
 * The structuring element is assumed to be composed of binary values
 * (zero or one). Only elements of the structuring element having
 * values > 0 ("on" values) are candidates for affecting the center
 * pixel.
 *
 * 
 * For the each input image pixel, 
 *   - NeighborhoodIterator gives neighbors of the pixel. 
 *   - Evaluate() member function returns either the original pixel value
 *     or the ErodeValue.
 *   - Replace the original value with the specified value
