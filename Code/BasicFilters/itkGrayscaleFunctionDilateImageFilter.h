/** \class GrayscaleFunctionDilateImageFilter
 * \brief gray scale function dilation of an image
 *
 * Dilate an image using functional grayscale morphology. Function
 * dilation takes the maximum of all the pixels identified by the
 * structuring element plus the structuring element value.
 *
 * The structuring element can be composed of arbitrary nonnegative
 * values (not restricted to zero or one). Element values greater than
 * zero indicate pixels that will be considered during the dilation.
 * The function dilation operation is defined as the maxixum over the
 * element of the image value PLUS the structuring element value.
 * 
 * For the each input image pixel, 
 *   - NeighborhoodIterator gives neighbors of the pixel. 
 *   - Evaluate() member function returns the maximum value among 
 *     the image neighbors plus the kernel value where the kernel has
 *     elements > 0.
 *   - Replace the original value with the max value
