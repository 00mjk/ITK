/** \class TwoOutputExampleImageFilter
 * \brief Example of a filter that produce two outputs. 
 *
 * TwoOutputExampleImageFilter sets image values to a user-specified "outside"
 * value (by default, "black") if the image values are below, above, or
 * between simple threshold values. The filter can produce two outputs,
 * one the inverse of the other. (GetOutput() returns an image whose
 * pixels satisfy the threshold values and are passed to the output 
 * unchanged (and those that don't are marked with the outside user-value);
 * GetInverseOutput() returns an image in which pixels satisfying the
 * threshold are marked "outside", and the other pixel values are passed
 * through.)
 *
 * The pixels must support the operators >= and <=.
