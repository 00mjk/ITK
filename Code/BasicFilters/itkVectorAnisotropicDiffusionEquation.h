/** \class VectorAnisotropicDiffusionEquation
 * \brief need one
 * Requirements:
 *      1) Image PixelType must have an internal typedef of ValueType,
 *            i.e. TImage::PixelType::ValueType must be defined as the
 *                 as the type of one value (element/component) of a pixel.
 *                 Since we are talking about vector anisotropic diffusion,
 *                 this is the type of an element of the vector (float, etc.)
