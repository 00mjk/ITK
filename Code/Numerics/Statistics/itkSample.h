/** \class Sample 
 *  \brief Sample defines common iterfaces for each subclasses
 *
 * A measurement vector is a vector of different types of values. For example,
 * users might have an image with each pixel have a gray level intensity value
 * and a gradient magnitude. In this example, user think each pixel as a 
 * measurement vector that has two types of values, intensity and gradient
 * magnitude. In this sense, the meaning of "measurement" can be interchaneable 
 * with "measurement".
 * 
 * The primary purpose of Sample clases are storing such 
 * measurement vectors and providing different types of element access methods.
 *
 * The "TMeasurement" template argument defines the type of each values
 * in a measurement vector. The "VMeasurementVectorSize" template argument 
 * defines 
 * the number of elements in a measurement vector. The type of measurement 
 * vector 
 * is fixed as ITK Point. The resulting measurement vector type is 
 * Point< TMeasurement, VMeasurementVectorSize >.
 *
 * There are two common ways of accessing data. First, users can use 
 * an "InstanceIdentifier", say 'id' which is sequential index of 
 * measurement vectors to access a measurement vector in a container. 
 * Second, users can access a measurement value using dimension and 
 * the index of a measurement value, say 'n' in that dimension. The 'id' and 'n'
 * is equal in the ListSample classes. However, in Histogram class, its
 * different. See Histogram. For algorithms using these indexes, there are
 * methods to get the length of each dimension, GetSize() and 
 * GetSize(dimension). See each method's comment.
 *
 * Users may need to know two other groups of methods to fully utilize
 * Sample. One group of methods is about frequency of measurement
 * vectors. In Histogram classes, you can use such methods to get/set the
 * frequency of each measurement vector. The other group of methods is about
 * characteristics of each subclasses of this class. If user want to 
 * create or know the characteristics of a subclass, use them. The set of
 * characteristics tell that if the data is sorted (true for Histogram),
 * if the each measurement vector is unique (true for Histogram), and if the
 * container supports "meaningful" frequency interfaces. In ListSample
 * classes, users cannot set frequency, and GetFrequency() methods return 
 * one if the element exists, else zero. So, currently ListSample's
 * supporting frequency is set to false.
