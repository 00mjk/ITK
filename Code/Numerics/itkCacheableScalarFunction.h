/** \class CacheableScalarFunction
 * \brief function cache implementation
 *
 * This is the base class for continuous scalar functions which
 * needs cache for their pre-evaluated function returns.
 * 
 * The internal cache is created using the upper- and lower-bound domain
 * values of the functional form (f(x))of subclasses of this class. So the
 * cache only stores pre-evaluated values between f(lower-bound) and 
 * f(upper-bound).
 *
 * To create a cache for continuous function, it uses sampling. 
 * With the given sample number , upper-bound, and lower-bound, it calculates
 * interval within the ranges. It pre-evaluates and save f(x) 
 * where x = lower-bound + interval * [0 - sample number]
 *
 * If a subclass of this class want to use a cache, it should 
 * explicitly call CreateCache(...) member function. GetCachedValue(x) will
 * return pre-evaluated f(x) value. However, the return value from 
 * GetCachedValue(x) might be different from the exact return value from f(x)
 * which is Evaluate(x) member function of subclasses of this class, because
 * The GetCachedValue(x) member function internally converts x to cache table
 * index and the conversion involves with truncation. So, users can think the
 * cached value as an approximate to exact function return.
 * 
 * In some case, approximate values can be useful.   
 * For example, CompositeValleyFunction can be used as an M-estimator and
 * it is currently used for MRIBiasFieldCorrectionFilter 
 * as an energy function. The bias field estimation requires calculation of 
 * energy values again and again for each iteration.
