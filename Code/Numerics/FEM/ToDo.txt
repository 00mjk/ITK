1. - Make modifications to all FEM classes so that they use the (new) itk::Mesh to represent geometry
      a. DOFs are maintained automatically by elements
      b. Node objects have to be created by user and must contain displacement objects
   - Create the LinearSystemWrapper class for use with the ITPACK

2. - 2D registration example
   - Create new LoadBC class for boundary conditions that preserve positive definitness of master stiffness matrix.
   - Determine the way dynamic elements will be handled
   - Restructure class inheritance of elements to reduce code duplication


3. - Fix and complete the code for 3d elements.
   - Implement LoadEdge handling in 3d elements


4. - Nonlinear elements
   - C1 elements
