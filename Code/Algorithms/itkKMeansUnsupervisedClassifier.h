/** \class KMeansUnsupervisedClassifier
 * \brief Implementation KMeansUnsupervisedClassifier object
 *
 * This object performs clustering of data sets into different clusters
 * either using a user provided seed points as initial guess or generates
 * the clusters using a recursive approach when the user provides the
 * number of desired clusters. Each cluster is represented by its cluster
 * center. The two algorithms used are the generalized Lloyd
 * algorithm (GLA) and the Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithms. The cluster centers
 * are also referred to as codewords and a table of cluster centers is 
 * is referred as a codebook.
 *
 * As required by the GLA algorithm, the initial seed cluster should contain 
 * approximate centers of clusters.  The GLA algorithm genrates an updated
 * cluster centers that result in a lower distortion than the input seed 
 * cluster when the input vectors are mapped/classified/labelled using the 
 * given codebooks.
 *
 * If no codebook is provided, the Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm is used.
 * This algorithm uses the GLA algorithm at its core to generate the
 * centroids of the input vectors (data). However, since there is no initial
 * codebook, LBG first creates a one word codebook (or centroid of one
 * cluster comprising of all the input training vectors). The LBG uses 
 * codeword/or centroid splitting to create increasing number of clusters.
 * Each new set of clusters are optimized using the GLA algorithm. 
 * The number of clusters increases as $2^{n}$ n= 0, 1, ... The codebook 
 * is expected to be in the form of a vnl matrix, where there are N rows.
 * each row representing the cluster mean of a given cluster. The number
 * of columns in a the codebook should be equal to the input image vector
 * dimension.
 *
 * The threshold parameter controls the ``optimality'' of the returned
 * codebook where optimality is related to the least possible
 * mean-squared error distortion that can be found by the algorithm.
 * For larger thresholds, the result will be less optimal.  For
 * smaller thresholds, the result will be more optimal.  If a more
 * optimal result is desired, then the algorithm will take longer to
 * complete. A reasonable threshold value is 0.01.
 *
 * If, during the operation of the algorithm, there are any unused
 * clusters or cells, the m_OffsetAdd and m_OffsetMultiply parameters is
 * used to split the cells with the highest distortion.  This
 * functions will attempt to fill empty cells up to 10 times (unless
 * the overall distortion is zero). Using 0.01 is a reasonable default  
 * values for the m_OffsetAdd and m_OffsetMultiply parameters.
 *
 * If the GLA is unable to resolve the data into the desired number of
 * clusters or cells, only the codewords which were used will be
 * returned. 
 *
 * In terms of clustering, codewords are cluster centers, and a codebook
 * is a table containing all cluster centers.  The GLA produces results
 * that are equivalent to the K-means clustering algorithm.
 *
 * For more information about the algorithms, see A. Gersho and R. M. Gray,
 * {\em Vector Quantization and Signal Compression},
 * Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA, 1992.
 *
 * This object supports data handling of multiband images. The object
 * accepts the input image in vector format only, where each pixel is a 
 * vector and each element of the vector corresponds to an entry from
 * 1 particular band of a multiband dataset. A single band image is treated 
 * as a vector image with a single element for every vector. The classified
 * image is treated as a single band scalar image. Currently there is no
 * support for generating a classified image. This class can be extended by
 * overriding the virtual GetPixelDistance() function.
