/** \class VoronoiSegmentationImageFilter
 * 
 * Perform the segmentation of 2D images (single channel) by Voronoi Diagram.
 * Used as a node of the segmentation toolkits.
 * The parameters here are: 
 * 1. the estimation of the statistics of the object. (mean and std.)
 * 2. the tolerance for the classification. (around the mean ans std. estimated value).
 *
 * The parameters can also be automatically set by given a prior, as a binary
 * image.
 *
 * Detail information about this algorithm can be found in:
 *  " Semi-automated color segmentation of anatomical tissue,"
 *   C. Imelinska, M. Downes, and W. Yuan
