/** \class LevelSetNeighborhoodExtractor
 * \brief Locate pixels of a particular level set.
 *
 * LevelSetNeighborhoodExtractor locates a particular level set in the input
 * level set. Specifically, the method Locate() fills two containers: one
 * containing pixels immediately inside the contour defined by the level set
 * and the other containing pixels immediately outside.  For each located
 * pixel, an estimated distance to the particular level set is also
 * calculated.
 *
 * The containers InsidePoints and OutsidePoints can then be used 
 * in FastMarchingImageFilter to produce a signed distance map from 
 * the specified level set.
 *
 * This class is templated over the image type representing
 * the level set.
 *
 * This class supports narrowbanding. If a input narrowband is
 * provided, the alogrithm will only serach of pixels within the
 * narrowband.
 *
 * Implemenation of this class is based on Chapter 11 of
 * "Level Set Methods and Fast Marching Methods", J.A. Sethian,
 * Cambridge Press, Second edition, 1999.
