/** \class KLMRegionGrowImageFilter
 * \brief Base class for a region growing object that performs energy-based 
 * region growing for multiband images.  
 * 
 * itkKLMRegionGrowImageFilter is the base class for the KLMRegionGrowImageFilter objects.
 * This object performes energy-based region growing for multiband images. 
 * Since this is based on G. Koepfler,C. Lopez and J. M. Morel's work 
 * described below, the acronym KLM is added at the end of the object name
 * .
 * The ApplyRegionGrowImageFilter() function implements the segmentation algorithm
 * that partitions the input image into non-overlapping regions
 * by minimizing an energy functional which trades off the similarity
 * of regions against the length of their shared boundary. The heart of the
 * prcess relies on the MergeRegion() method that calls a private function
 * to perform the merging of region based on the piecewise constance KLM
 * algorithm for region merging. For extensibiltiy purposes, the MergeRegion()
 * function is made virtual. Extensions can be made possible using
 * function overloading or overriding the virutual function in a derived 
 * class. It starts by breaking the image into many small regions and fitting 
 * the regions to a polynomial model.  The algorithm iteratively merges into
 * one region the two adjoining regions which are most alike in terms
 * of the specified polynomial model given the length of the border
 * between the two regions.  Internally, the energy functional is
 * evaluated using a Lagrangian parameter called lambda which is also
 * called the scale parameter as it controls the coarseness of the
 * segmentation where a small value of lambda corresponds to a finer
 * segmentation with more regions and a large value corresponds to a
 * coarse segmentation with fewer regions.  Since the algorithm grows
 * regions by merging like regions, the internal value of lambda
 * increases as the number of regions decreases.
 *
 * The user can stop the merging of regions using the SetMaxNumRegions() 
 * and SetLambda() functions.  The SetMaxNumRegions() fuction is publicly
 * inherited from its base class and internally sets the m_MaxNumRegions
 * parameter. The SetLambda() function sets the m_Lambda parameter. If the
 * number of regions in the image is equal to m_MaxNumRegions or if the
 * internal energy functional becomes greater than m_Lambda, then the 
 * merging iterations will stop.  Note that a larger value for m_Lambda
 * will result in fewer boundaries and fewer regions, while a smaller value 
 * for m_Lambda will result in more boundaries and more regions. To have 
 * m_MaxNumRegions control exactly the number of output regions, m_Lamda 
 * should be set to a very large number. To have m_Lambda control exactly 
 * the number of output regions, m_MaxNumRegions should be set to 2. As a 
 * default value the maximum lambda value is set to 1000 and m_MaxNumRegions
 * is set to 2 as default. 
 *
 * Currently implementation puts equal weight to the multichannel values.
 * In future improvements we plan to allow the user to control the weights
 * associated with each individual channels. 
 *
 * It is templated over the type of input and output image. This object 
 * supports data handling of multiband images. The object accepts images 
 * in vector format, where each pixel is a vector and each element of the
 * vector corresponds to an entry from 1 particular band of a multiband 
 * dataset. We expect the user to provide the input to the routine in vector 
 * format. A single band image is treated as a vector image with a single  
 * element for every vector.
 * 
 * This algorithm implementation takes a multiband image stored in vector
 * format as input and produces two outputs. Using the ImageToImageFilter, 
 * the piecewise constant approximation image is the output calculated
 * using the process update mechanism. The second output, i.e., the 
 * image with the region labels (segmentation image) is returned at 
 * users request by calling GetLabelledImage() function. This function
 * returns a reference to the labelled image determined using the KLM 
 * algorithm. 
 *
 * For more information about the algorithm, see G. Koepfler, C. Lopez
 * and J. M. Morel, ``A Multiscale Algorithm for Image Segmentation by
 * Variational Method,'' {\em SIAM Journal of Numerical Analysis},
 * vol. 31, pp. 282-299, 1994.
 *
 * Algorithm details:
 *
 * This function segments a two-dimensional input image into
 * non-overlapping regions $O_i$, i=1,2,...,N, where N is the total
 * number of region, by minimizing the following energy functional
 * (also known as the simplified Mumford and Shah functional):
 * $E(u,K)=\int_{\Omega-K}||u(r,c)-g(r,c)||^2{d{\Omega}}+\lambda\cdot{L(K)}$,
 * where $\Omega$ denotes the domain of an image, g(r,c) is the input
 * image, and u(r,c) is an approximation of g(r,c).  Furthermore,
 * u(r,c) is defined to be piecewise constant in regions $O_i$.  If
 * $\partial O_i$ represents the boundary of the region,
 * $K=\bigcup_{i=1}^N\partial{O_i}$ denotes the set of all region
 * boundaries and L(K) is the total length of the boundaries.  The
 * parameter $\lambda$ controls the coarseness of the segmentation
 * (i.e. a larger $\lambda$ will result in fewer boundaries).  
 *
 * Starting with small, piecewise-constant initial regions the algorithm
 * iteratively merges the two adjacent regions $O_i$ and $O_j$ which  most 
 * decrease the energy functional.  In other words, the merging criterion 
 * is based on the difference between the current energy E(u,K) and the 
 * energy that would result after a merge, $E(\hat{u},K-\partial(O_i,O_j))$,
 * where $\hat{u}$ is the piecewise constant approximation of the
 * input image g, and $\partial(O_i,O_j)$ is the common boundary
 * between region $O_i$ and $O_j$.  It can be shown that
 * $E(u,K)-E(\hat{u},K-\partial(O_i,O_j))=
 * \lambda\cdot{L(\partial(O_i,O_j))}- 
 * {(|O_i| \cdot |O_j|)\over (|O_i|+|O_j|)} ||c_i-c_j||^2$.
 *
 * Once two regions are merged the following update equations are used
 * to calculated the  constant approximation of the new region:
 * 
 * $c_{i,j} = (c_i |O_i| + c_j |O_j|) \over (|O_i| + |O_j|)$.
 *
 * Again, the merging of regions continues until the desired number of
 * regions has been reached or until the desired coarseness (specified
 * by the scale parameter $\lambda$) has been reached.
 *
 * The two outputs are possible to derive from the object: 
 * (1) u, the piecewise constant approximation (mean of the regions)
 *     to the input image set; This is currently generated by the 
 *     process object pipeline and the 
 * (2) the labelled regions in the input image set is generated by the
 *     GetLabelledImage() function.
