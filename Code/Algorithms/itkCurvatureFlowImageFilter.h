/** \class CurvatureFlowImageFilter
  * \brief Denoise an image using curvature driven flow.
  *
  * CurvatureFlowImageFilter implements a curvature driven image denoising 
  * algorithm. Iso-brightness contours in the input image are viewed as a 
  * level set. The level set is then evolved using a curvature-based speed 
  * function.
  *
  * The advantage of this approach is that sharp boundaries are preserved
  * with smoothing occuring only within a region.
  *
  * Note that unlike level set segmentation algorithms,
  * the image to be denoised is already the level set and can be set
  * directly as the input using the SetInput() method.
  *
  * This filter has two parameters: the number of update iterations to 
  * be performed and the timestep between each update.
  *
  * This filter make use of the multi-threaded finite difference solver hierarchy. 
  * Updates are computed using a CurvatureFlowEquation object. A zero 
  * flux Neumann boundary condition when computing derivatives
  * near the data boundary.
  *
  * This filter may be streamed. To support streaming this filter produces a 
  * padded output which takes into account edge effects. The size of the padding
  * is m_NumberOfIterations on each edge. Users of this filter should
  * only make use of the center valid central region.
  *
  * \warning
  * This filter assumes that the input and output types have the same dimensions.
  *

  * "Level Set Methods and Fast Marching Methods", J.A. Sethian,
  * Cambridge Press, Chapter 16, Second edition, 1999.
