/** \class GeodesicActiveContourImageFilter
 * \brief Edge based shape detection using geodesic active contours.
 *
 * GeodesicActiveContourImageFilter is a level set approach for boundary detection.
 * An initial contour is evolved to minimise a weighted curve length
 * functional, where the weight depends on the edge potential function.
 *
 * The advantage of this approach over ShapeDetectionLevelSetFilter is that the 
 * evolution equation has an addition term which acts like a doublet and 
 * attracts the contour to the shape boundaries. This improves boundary 
 * detection in cases where edge features are weak.
 *
 * This class requires three inputs: an initial level set,
 * a edge potential map and the derivatives of the edge potential.
 *
 * The initial level set is a floating point image which contains the
 * initial contour as the zero level set. For example, a signed distance
 * function from the initial front is typically used.
 *
 * The edge potential image has values close to zero in regions
 * of high image gradient and values close to one in regions with
 * relatively constant intensity.
 *
 * This class is templated on the image type which represent the 
 * level set, the type of the edge potential image and the type oft
 * the edge potential derivatives.
 *
 * This class supports narrowbanding, where at each iteration only
 * a narrow band surrounding the propagating front is updated.
 *
 * Implementation of this class is based on:
 * "Geodesic Active Contours",
 * V. Caselles, R. Kimmel and G. Sapiro.
 * International Journal on Computer Vision,
 * Vol 22, No. 1, pp 61-97, 1997
 *
 * \sa ShapeDetection
 *
 * Possible improvements:
 * - In Caselles et al (1997) it is stated that extension of the
 * velocities at each iteration is not required. However, this causes
 * the level sets to bunch with near edges causing possible instabilities.
 * Future implementation should look at including velocity extension
 * as suggested in
 * "Area and Length Minimizing Flows for Shape Segmentation"
 * K. Siddiqi, Y. Lauziere, A. Tannenbaum and S. Zucker.
 * IEEE Transaction on Image Processing
 * Vol 7, No. 3 March 1998
 *
 * - In the narrowband version, allow the user to specify the
 * number of iterations before reinitialization.
 *
 * - Add support to detect convergence.
