/** \class SegmentationRegion
 * \brief Base class for SegmentationRegion object
 * 
 * itkSegmentationRegion is the base class for the SegmentationRegion objects. It provides
 * the basic function definitons that are inherent to a SegmentationRegion objects.
 * A region object is defined by the label it owns. We use integer labels
 * to represent a region. No two regions can have the same labels This 
 * object stores the region label. The user can get the area, mean region 
 * intensity and a unique label associate with the region through access
 * functions provided publicly. The unique label parameter is used at the 
 * end of a region growing class to associate a region with a new label  
 * that characterises the region after several regions have been merged. 
 * This class provides an interface method called ApplySegmentationRegion to enable
 * future extension of the region object.
 *
