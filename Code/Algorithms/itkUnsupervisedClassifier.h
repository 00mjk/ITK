/** \class UnsupervisedClassifier
 * \brief Base class for UnupervisedClassifier object
 *
 * itkUnsupervisedClassifier is the base class for all the classes that do
 * not require training data set. This object clusters the input data
 * based on some criteria. For instance, in case of the Kmeans algorithm, it
 * the criteria used is based on Euclidean distance. The input data could be
 * a image/volume or any set of feature vector. It can be used in any 
 * place where clustering is needed but no prior information is availavble.
 * This can be used to generate a codebook for vector quatinzation 
 * application. All the user needs to provide is the number of classes. 
 * The interface to classifying images is provided through the virtual
 * functions with this object.
 *
 * This object supports data handling of multiband images. The object
 * accepts the input image in vector format only, where each pixel is a 
 * vector and each element of the vector corresponds to an entry from
 * 1 particular band of a multiband dataset. A single band image is treated 
 * as a vector image with a single element for every vector. The classified
 * image is treated as a single band scalar image.
