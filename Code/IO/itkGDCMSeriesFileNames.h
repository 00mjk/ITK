/** \class GDCMSeriesFileNames
 * \brief Generate a sequence of filenames from a DICOM series.
 *
 * This class generate a sequence of files whose filenames points to 
 * a DICOM file. The oredring is based on the following strategy:
 * Read all images in the directory (assuming there is only one study/serie)
 *
 *   1. Extract Image Orientation & Image Position from DICOM images, and then
 *      calculate the ordering based on the 3D coordinate of the slice
 *   2. If for some reason this information is not found or failed, another 
 *      strategy is used: the ordering is based on 'Image Number'
 *   3. If this strategy also failed, then the filenames are ordered by 
 *      lexicographical filenames.
