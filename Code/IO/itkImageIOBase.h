 * \brief Abstract superclass for IO classes.

 *  TOutputImage is the type expected by the external users of the
 *  filter. Data comming from a file can be stored in any other format (or
 *  type) this filter converts data between the file type and the external
 *  expected type.  The ConvertTraits template arguement is used to do the
 *  conversion.
 *
 *  A Pluggable factory pattern is used this allows different kinds of readers
 *  to be registered (even at run time) without having to modify the
 *  code in this class.
