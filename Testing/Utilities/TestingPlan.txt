The Insight testing environment contians three concepts:

Site - A testing site, currently a domain name such as crd.ge.com
BuildName - A combination of OS, OS revision and compiler
BuildStamp - A date time stamp of the form YearMonthDayHourMinute in GMT, i.e. 200009291300 is September 29, 2000 1:00 pm GMT

The Site and BuildName directories live under
Insight/Testing/HTML/TestingResults, and are created at configure
time.  The BuildStamp directory is created during a build.

BuildStamp creation:

tclsh Testing/Utilities/Build.tcl
tclsh Testing/Utilities/Test.tcl

These two tcl programs result in two files:
Testing/HTML/TestingResults/Site/Instance/BuildStamp/XML/Build.xml
Testing/HTML/TestingResults/Site/Instance/BuildStamp/XML/Test.xml

At the BuildStamp level, the XML gets transformed by Build.xsl and
Test.xsl into HTML.

For roll up to a top level dashboard, each of the Build.xml and
Test.xml files from the most recent BuildStamp for each BuildName are
combined into one XML file called Dashboard.xml.  The XSL file
Testing/Utilities/XSL/Dashboard.xsl is used to create the toplevel
dashboard with links to the most recent results.
